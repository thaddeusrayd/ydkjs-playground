/*
NOTES

JS is one of very few languages that allow you to create objects directly and explicitly without first 
defining its structure in a class

Before ES6 and its <class> keyword, people implemented class design pattern on top of prototypes - 
"prototypal inheritance"

Letting objects act as objects and cooperate with each other through the prototype chain is called "behavior
delegation" or "object delegation", and the author argues that it's more powerful and "with the grain" of JS 
than classes
